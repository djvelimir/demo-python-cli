## Sequence Diagram

In a sequence diagram for a password generator application, the user initiates the process by launching the CLI application with the command to generate a password. The application triggers the password generation function. This function then systematically ensures that the generated password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special symbol, employing randomization to meet these criteria. Once the password is successfully generated, the application returns the secure password to the user, completing the interaction seamlessly without requiring any additional settings.

## Class Diagram

The class diagram for a CLI password generator application outlines a system that automates the creation of secure passwords. At its core, the generator utilizes an algorithm that ensures each password includes at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one numeral, and one special character. The password generation process randomly selects characters from predefined sets corresponding to each required category. The system outputs a strong password without requiring any user input, enhancing convenience while ensuring security standards are met.
